- `--verbose`: Show detailed processing information
- `--output <file>`: Specify custom output filename
- `--adaptive`: Enable adaptive reconstruction for lossy networks (new in v3.0)
- `--ai-optimize`: Use AI to predict and recover missing segments (new in v3.0)

Example:

```bash
./pcapdata test.pcap --verbose --ai-optimize --output reconstructed_file
```

### 2. AI-Enhanced Malicious Code Analysis

The third-generation system provides comprehensive AI-driven analysis of malicious code:

1. **Integrated Analysis Pipeline**:

   ```bash
   ./analyze_malware.py <target_file> [options]
   ```

   Options:
   - `--full-analysis`: Perform comprehensive analysis including root cause and exploit methods
   - `--export-format <format>`: Export results (json, html, pdf)
   - `--threat-level <1-10>`: Minimum threat level to report
   - `--mitre-mapping`: Map findings to MITRE ATT&CK framework

2. **AI Root Cause Analysis**:

   ```bash
   ./ai_analyzer.py --root-cause <analyzed_file> [options]
   ```

   This will generate an in-depth explanation of:
   - Vulnerability classification and severity
   - Technical mechanism of the vulnerability
   - Code path analysis with affected components
   - Associated CWE/CVE references and similar vulnerabilities
   - Potential impact assessment

3. **AI Exploit Methodology Analysis**:

   ```bash
   ./ai_analyzer.py --exploit-method <analyzed_file> [options]
   ```

   This produces detailed insights into:

   - Required preconditions for exploitation
   - Potential attack variations
   - Success probability assessment
   - Defense evasion techniques employed

4. **Dynamic Validation in QEMU**:

   Enhanced environment for observing exploit execution:

   ```bash
   ./dynamic_analysis.py --vm-config standard --record-behavior --target <file>
   ```
