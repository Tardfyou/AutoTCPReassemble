# AutoTCPReassemble v4.0 (Fourth Edition)

**Huazhong University of Science and Technology**
2025 Spring Network and System Security Course Design - AI and Workflow Enhanced Version

## Overview

**AutoTCPReassemble** has evolved into its fourth-generation optimization, building upon the advanced AI-powered capabilities of v3.0. This version introduces a refined workflow for vulnerability and malicious code analysis, emphasizing a two-stage approach that combines automated scripting with interactive, precise analysis using MVC technology and IDA Pro integration. This leads to semi-automated, highly accurate determination of vulnerability and malicious code root causes.

1.  **TCP Stream Reassembly**: This core feature continues to allow the reassembly of data from captured network traffic (PCAP files), processing TCP packets to reconstruct transmitted files with enhanced accuracy and resilience to network anomalies.
2.  **Malicious Code Detection and Analysis**: This feature has been significantly enhanced. Beyond the AI capabilities of v3.0, v4.0 introduces a structured two-stage analysis process for more precise and efficient results.

### Key Enhancements in v4.0 (Fourth Edition):

**1. New Two-Stage Vulnerability and Malicious Code Analysis Workflow:**

This version formalizes and enhances the analysis process into two distinct stages:

* **Stage 1: Initial Automated Detection and Screening:**
    * Utilizes automated scripts (e.g., based on "IDA Pro Vulnerability and Malicious Code Analysis Tool v2.0") for a rapid initial scan.
    * Quickly identifies potential vulnerabilities (e.g., Stack Overflow, Heap Overflow, Use After Free, Format String Vulnerability) and malicious code indicators (e.g., System File Deletion, Privilege Escalation, Backdoor Programs, Zombie Processes, Disabling System Protection).
    * **Example Automated Script Output:**
        ```
        ================================
        IDA Pro Vulnerability and Malicious Code Analysis Tool
        Version: 2.0
        ================================
        Initiating software vulnerability detection...
        Vulnerability Detected - Function: Vul_func12, Type: Stack Overflow, Address: 0x17ed, Trigger: .strncpy
        ... (other vulnerabilities) ...
        Software vulnerability detection complete.
        --------------------------------
        Initiating malicious code detection...
        Malicious Code Detected - Function: Mal_func1, Type: System File Deletion & Modification, Address: 0x14c8, Evidence: /var/log/auth.log
        ... (other malicious code) ...
        Malicious code detection complete.
        ```

* **Stage 2: Semi-Automated Precise Analysis with MVC-IDA Integration:**
    * Following the initial scan, leverages MVC (Model-View-Controller) technology integrated with IDA Pro for granular analysis.
    * Focuses on meticulously examining flagged items to understand exact root causes and specific functionalities.
    * Enables a semi-automated yet highly accurate and detailed analytical outcome.
    * **Example of Detailed Vulnerability Cause Analysis:**
        * **Vulnerability Type:** Stack Overflow
        * **Vulnerable Function:** `strncpy`
        * **Invocation Address:** `0x17ed`
        * **Root Cause:** In `Vul_func12`, `strncpy` uses a dynamically computed length (`*(char *)(a1 + 50) + *(char *)(a1 + 70)`), without validating if it exceeds the destination buffer `dest[24]` size.
    * **Example of Detailed Malicious Code Functionality:**
        * **Functionality Type:** Open Backdoor
        * **System Call Used:** `system`
        * **Invocation Address:** `0x15f9`
        * **Specific Description:** Uses `system` to execute `"nc -l -p 54321 > hustlogo.png"`, creating a backdoor listening on port 54321.

    * Step-by-step analysis of attack vectors and exploitation paths.
    * Impact assessment with CVSS scoring automation.
    * Contextual recommendations for vulnerability remediation.
    * Potential exploit variation analysis through generative models.

**4. Advanced Systems Integration (Continued from v3.0):**
    * Seamless integration with threat intelligence platforms.
    * Real-time vulnerability database synchronization.
    * Automated reporting to security information and event management (SIEM) systems.

./pcapdata <input_pcap_file> [options]
````

Options:

  * `--verbose`: Show detailed processing information
  * `--output <file>`: Specify custom output filename
  * `--adaptive`: Enable adaptive reconstruction for lossy networks
  * `--ai-optimize`: Use AI to predict and recover missing segments

Example:

```bash
./pcapdata test.pcap --verbose --ai-optimize --output reconstructed_file
```

### 2\. Enhanced Malicious Code and Vulnerability Analysis (v4.0 Workflow)

The fourth-generation system provides a comprehensive analysis workflow:

1.  **Run Initial Automated Scan:**

      * (User would specify how to run their initial script here, e.g., a Python script that calls IDA or another tool)
      * Example: `python run_initial_scan.py --target <target_file_or_pcap>`
      * This script produces an initial report similar to the "IDA Pro Vulnerability and Malicious Code Analysis Tool v2.0" output.

2.  **Perform MVC-IDA Integrated Precise Analysis:**

      * (User would specify how to initiate the MVC-IDA linked analysis, possibly loading initial scan results into an MVC tool that interfaces with IDA Pro)
      * Example: `python launch_mvc_ida_analyzer.py --input_scan_results results.json`
      * This step allows for interactive exploration and detailed root cause analysis as previously described.

3.  **AI Root Cause Analysis (Complementary):**

    ```bash
    ./ai_analyzer.py --root-cause <analyzed_file_or_context> [options]
    ```

    This can be used alongside or after the MVC-IDA step for AI-generated explanations.

4.  **AI Exploit Methodology Analysis (Complementary):**

    ```bash
    ./ai_analyzer.py --exploit-method <analyzed_file_or_context> [options]
    ```

5.  **Dynamic Validation in QEMU:**
    Enhanced environment for observing exploit execution:

    ```bash
    ./dynamic_analysis.py --vm-config standard --record-behavior --target <file>
    ```
